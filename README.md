m'dotfiles

important
--------
you need (obviously) prepend some files with a period for them to work. i omitted this detail so they would show up properly on github.

i use these programs:
* xmonad
* xmobar
* xmodmap
* ~~xbindkeys~~
* urxvt/urxvtd/urxvtc
* ~~NetworkManager~~
* feh
* ~~nano~~
* vim

what's included
--------
* my xresources (terminal colors/schema/extensions)
* xmonad config
* xmobar config
* bash config/aliases/terminal prompts/etc
* "bespoke" gtk-2 theme i (sort of) made
* wallpapers that aren't mine
* vim config

avec l'amour toujours,
