m'dotfiles

important
--------
you need (obviously) prepend some files with a period for them to work. i omitted this detail so they would show up properly on github.

i use these programs:
*xmonad
*xmobar
*xbindkeys
*urxvt/urxvtd/urxvtc
*NetworkManager
*feh
*nano (don't hate)
*some others i'm forgetting

what's included
--------
*my xresources (terminal colors/schema/extensions)
*xmonad config
*xmobar config
*xinit sequence
*bash config/aliases/terminal prompts/etc
*nano syntax highlighting rc files
*"bespoke" gtk-2 theme i (sort of) made
*bound keys with xbindkeys
*helpful scripts
*wallpapers that aren't mine
*hopefully none of my passwords or personal information


avec l'amour toujours,
