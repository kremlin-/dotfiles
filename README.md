m'dotfiles

important
--------
you need (obviously) prepend some files with a period for them to work. i omitted this detail so they would show up properly on github.

i use these programs:
* xmonad
* xmobar
* xmodmap
* xbindkeys
* urxvt/urxvtd/urxvtc
* NetworkManager
* feh
* nano (don't hate)
* emacs
* some others i'm forgetting

what's included
--------
* my xresources (terminal colors/schema/extensions)
* xmonad config
* xmobar config
* xinit sequence
* bash config/aliases/terminal prompts/etc
* nano syntax highlighting rc files
* "bespoke" gtk-2 theme i (sort of) made
* bound keys with xbindkeys
* anti-emacs pinky
* helpful scripts
* wallpapers that aren't mine
* hopefully none of my passwords or personal information


avec l'amour toujours,
kremlin
